How to use the program?

    Download the LISP file
    Load the LISP program. There are several ways to load AutoLISP program, but this is the easiest way. Thanks Ellen!
    I wrote the code to run when I type LB then [enter]. You should be able to use it after you load the program.
    You need to click twice: the point you want to label and label location.
    It will use leader command. So if it’s too large, too small, or you want to customize it, change your style.
    It is also use file UNITS settings. If you want to change the format to decimal or architecture format, change it in UNITS settings.
    The program will continue to ask you for points until you press [esc] or [enter]. I decide to make it this way because mostly we want to create several labels at once. So you don’t need to reactivate it after you have labeled one point.
